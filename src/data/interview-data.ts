    introduction: 'I secured this interview opportunity through a direct application. The overall hiring process was heavily focused on adtech fundamentals, technical depth, and product thinking. Below is a structured round-by-round summary of my experience.',
    rounds: [
      {
        title: 'Round 1: Product Sense and AdTech Knowledge',
        content: "This round began with a discussion about my background, followed by a detailed walkthrough of my resume. The interviewer explored my past projects and specifically deep-dived into the awards section to understand the impact and context behind those achievements.\n\nThe conversation then transitioned into adtech fundamentals. I was asked to explain key industry concepts such as viewability, eCPM, impressions, rendering, key-values, and IAB segmentation taxonomy. The discussion progressed to more advanced topics, including cookies, optimization strategies within the Google ecosystem, and what additional optimizations can be implemented beyond default Google-provided mechanisms.\n\nWe also discussed the self-serve tools I had built and launched, focusing on their problem statements, execution strategy, and measurable outcomes.\n\nThe latter half of the round centered on product thinking, particularly how a product manager can improve ad performance metrics while maintaining a strong user experience. We discussed balancing monetization with user empathy, identifying the right touchpoints to implement user-centric models, and defining the boundaries to ensure ad improvements do not negatively impact overall product usability.",

        content: "This round again began with a discussion of my prior experience, followed by an assessment of my technical fundamentals. I was asked about concepts such as server-side rendering, HTTP protocols, secure communication channels, and general web architecture principles.\n\nThe conversation then shifted toward product strategy. I was asked: “How would you improve Google Maps?” I structured my answer around user segmentation, identifying core use cases, and proposing enhancements aligned with both user value and business objectives.\n\nThis was followed by a monetization-focused question: “How can we monetize Google Maps for non-business users?” I proposed that essential, high-frequency features should remain free to preserve user base and engagement. Premium, value-added features could be layered on top for monetization. I presented my response in a structured, story-driven format to ensure clarity and logical flow.\n\nThe interview concluded with standard HR and behavioral questions.",

I mapped out potential data sources, delivery touchpoints, and failure points across the funnel. Through this, I identified a likely root cause: a formatting issue in how contact details were being fetched, which led to shortened or failed message delivery and ultimately impacted repayments.\n\nThe round concluded with a few HR and behavioural questions to assess culture fit and communication style.",
